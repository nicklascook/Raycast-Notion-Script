# Raycast-Notion-Script 👷‍♂️

## Description

Script for easily generating [Raycast](https://raycast.com/) scripts from your Notion pages, in order to quickly open any page.

## Installation

## Roadmap

- [ ] Write tests
- [ ] Write a better README
- [ ] Ability to only select a certain "depth" of subpages

## Limitations & Known Bugs

- Does not correctly change the page when Notion is already in the foreground. Currently using a hacky opening of Finder to get around this.
